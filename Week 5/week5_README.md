Unit 5 Assignment 1 - C++ Project 


The hotel management system program implemented in C++ allows users to perform tasks related to managing hotel rooms and guests. The program allows adding guests to rooms, removing guests from rooms, and requesting room service (though this feature is not yet implemented). Also, the program has the option to display room occupancy, but this feature has not yet been implemented, as well. Users can also exit the program if they wish.
